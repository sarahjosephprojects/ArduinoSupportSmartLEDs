# Arduino support for smart LEDs
This temporary repository has been created for the duration of the evaluation.

Student: Sarah Joseph, Informatica, K.U. Leuven

This repository contains the implementation for ICSP communication with Arduino microcontrollers. The serial array of bytes in the ArduinoISP demo file can be replaced by data captured over VLC communication. The VLC protocol is described in the paper and can be integrated into the program. The data can then be uploaded directly to a target microcontroller or smart LED. The demo file and video contains the entire Blink sketch from the Arduino IDE within the serial array. The upload verification can be seen in the demo video.
