# Arduino Support for Smart LEDs 2018-19

This repository contains scripts for ICSSP communication with Arduino microcontrollers. The serial array in the ArduinoISP demo file can be replaced by data captured over VLC communication. The data can then be uploaded directly to the target microcontroller. The demo file and video contains the entire Blink program within the serial array. This program is uploaded with ICSP to the target.
