# Arduino support for smart LEDs

Student: Sarah Joseph, Informatica, K.U. Leuven

This repository contains the script for ICSP communication with Arduino microcontrollers. The serial array in the ArduinoISP demo file can be replaced by data captured over VLC communication within the programming section of the serial array. The VLC protocol is described in the paper and can be integrated into the program. The data can then be uploaded directly to a target microcontroller or smart LED. The demo file and video contains the entire Blink program within the serial array. The upload verification can be seen in the demo video.
